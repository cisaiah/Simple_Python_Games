### Number Guessing Game
In this game, the player has to guess a number the computer thinks of between 1 and 100.
If the player's guess is more than 10 away from the number, the player will be COLD
If the player's guess is within 10 from the number, the player will be WARM
The player will continue to guess until he guesses the number correctly
If the player's new guess is farther from the number than his most recent guess, the player will be getting COLDER
If the player's new guess is closer to the number than his most recent guess, the player will be getting WARMER
The lesser number of guesses it takes to get the number, the better the player's performance

At the start of the game, both the player and computer dealer is given 2 cards. They may both choose to hit for more cards or stay (stop receiving cards)
Whoever has a total card value closer to 21 wins that round and get the opponent's chips placed
However, if the total card value exceeds 21 while the opponent's total is below 21, the player exceeding 21bursts and losses that round. The opponent gets the chips placed
Jacks, Queen and King count as a value of 10
Aces can count as either 1 or 11, whichever the player or dealer chooses. Counting an Ace as 1 is softening the Ace
